## What are draft posts?

This is an example of a draft post. Draft posts aren't included when publishing your site.

This is great for authoring work in progress content, or hiding content that shouldn't be available at the current time.

It is not a trivial task to find a local ice cream store that sells ice cream _your mouth deserves_. \[This is the most ugly idiom I have ever heard, what about reading more?\] Oftentimes they don't even sell what we normally would refer as hand-made ice cream. If you happen to live **in the vicinity of such a store**, I have to admit that you are pretty lucky.

You don't have the luxury? Fear not my friends, I am here to teach you how to construct your local quality ice cream shop if you happen not to have one.

    import ice-cream-shop as ics
    
    ics.start()

And that's it!

Enjoy your quality ice creams.
